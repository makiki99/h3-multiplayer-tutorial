# Chapter 2 - Rules and customs
## Lesson 6 - Common rule changes

The one problem with the competitive rules in HoMM3 is that they are variable - every player might use some modifications to the rules. Some of these being more reasonable and having basis in the historical gameplay, some of these being pretty much house rules made just for fun.

### Amount of restarts
Sometimes, the game is played with a different amount of restarts: some player prefer 3 days of restarts instead of 2. If this happens your opponent will usually tell you.

### No red rush
It was a rule that is still used in Shadow of Death games, but is dropped in case of HotA matches. Some players still do use it, but more and more of them play without this rule.

### No DD/Fly/TP
Some player decide to ban control spells, which are: Dimension Door, Fly and Town Portal. Today this rule is rarely used, and for some people detracts from game.

### Changes to faction picking
There are multiple variants of elimination and trade methods - and there are ways to mix these too. Usually if there are any changes from the usual formula, the host will tell you.

### No tournament rules
Of course, this mostly applies to the casual games, but some templates are designed to be played without any rules except endless combat clause. Some players also enjoy the game played this way more.

With the knowledge of all those rules, etiquette, etc. you can start playing competitively. But as you will soon realize, competitive play is wildly different compared to what you might know about singleplayer. In the next chapter you'll learn the important theory that will help you play better.
